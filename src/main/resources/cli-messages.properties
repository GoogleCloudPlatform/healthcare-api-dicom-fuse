# DICOMFuse cli options
option.datasetAddr = Web address to the Dataset. Example: https://healthcare.googleapis.com/\
  v1beta1/projects/PROJECT/locations/LOCATION/datasets/DATASET
option.mountPath = Path to mount the Dataset. Example on Linux: /home/user/fuse-mount-folder. \
  Example on macOS: /Users/user/fuse-mount-folder Example on Windows: J:\\
option.keyFile = Path to the account service key
option.help = Print help
option.enableDeletion = Some programs can delete files and deletion can also be done \
  manually. Sometimes accidental deletions can occur. If you don't want to delete files, you can \
  set --enableDeletion=false
option.cacheTime = Each value in this option is measured in seconds. To optimize DICOMFuse, \
  the following resources are cached: DICOM store folders, Study folders, Series folders, list of \
  Instances (first parameter in option), and opened Instances files (second parameter). Opened \
  Instance files are cached to the temporary folder in the user space on disk. Other objects are \
  cached to RAM. Cached files will be deleted if you close DICOMFuse or if the cached files \
  become out of date. If you delete or upload an Instance file locally, the cache will be \
  invalidated, and updated if you open a folder again.
option.cacheSize = Maximum cache size in megabytes for cached instances. The maximum file \
  size that can be downloaded/uploaded is cacheSize / 4
option.extraMountOptions = You can add additional mount options for libfuse, WinFsp or OSXFuse. \
  Example: --extraMountOptions allow_other,option2=VALUE,etc  Note: since DICOMFuse is specific \
  for correct behavior in different operating systems, some mount options were included initially. \
